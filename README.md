# OilWellRegion

Choosing a location for a well
Let's say you work for the mining company GlavRosGosNeft. We need to decide where to drill a new well.

You have been provided with oil samples in three regions: in each of 10,000 fields, where the quality of oil and the volume of its reserves have been measured. Build a machine learning model to help determine the region where mining will bring the most profit. Analyze possible profits and risks using the Bootstrap technique.
Steps to select a location:

Deposits are searched for in the selected region, and the characteristic values ​​are determined for each;
Build a model and estimate the volume of reserves;
The deposits with the highest value estimates are selected. The number of fields depends on the company’s budget and the cost of developing one well;
The profit is equal to the total profit of the selected deposits.
